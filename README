======================================

For this assignment, you will make a roleplaying game. 

This is an "open ended assignment" meaning it will be graded by hand, and your
grade will be based on how many design criteria you fulfill. You will work
with a partner on this assignment, so my advice is to figure out early on who
will be responsible for each design criteria, and to set deadlines ahead of
the final deadline for when they'll be done. If your partner flakes, then
you'll have to pick up the work.

Purpose: To teach you how to work on programming assignments with other people
and to get experienced writing code on longer projects rather than little
functions or toy assignments. Also to learn how the design process works a
bit.

Design Criteria:
1) World Map that the user can move around
2) Combat of some sort, and some way of winning the game
3) Must have colors (Use #include "/public/colors.h")
4) Must have 5 puzzles to win the game
5) 40 lines of dialogue and/or descriptions of the world

Extra Credit:
1) Nonblocking I/O (also in colors.h)
2) Compose Original Music and Cover Art (Make it yourself) Upload music to
Youtube.
3) Inventory System

Each one of these is a letter grade. If you do none, you get a 0%, if you do
one you get an F (50%), two a D (60%), three a C (70%), four a B (80%), five
an A (100%), and each extra credit point is an extra 10% added to your grade.
So the max grade is 130%.
